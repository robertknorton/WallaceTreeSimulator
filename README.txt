Description:
Basic GUI script for calculating the values of 4x4, 6x6, and 8x8 Wallace Trees.
Wallace trees are a type of hardware used for high speed multiplication within graphics processors.
This script was created to aid computer and electrical engineering students validate their understanding of Wallace trees.

Setup:
1. To use this script you must have python3 installed on your computer. The script was written in Python 3.6.
2. The script utilizes two packages. One is tkinter which is included in all python disctributions after Python 3.1 and the other is Pillow.
3. Install pillow using pip on the command line. Example below.
	
	pip install Pillow

4. Now using file explorer navigate to the folder contain the wtapp.py file and shift-right click and choose the option "Open command window here".
This will open a command prompt at the directory of the wtapp.py file. Make sure the python file and the images are in the same folder.
5. Once the command prompt is open simply run the program by typing the following.

	python wtapp.py
	
Alternative to CMD to run script:
If you desire not to use the commandline to run the script every time you can use a Python IDE to open the code and run directly through the IDE.
I recommend Pycharm because it is straight forward, user friendly, and has a large amount of community support. https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
